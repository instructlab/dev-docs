# InstructLab's Dog Logo Name

## Scope

This document is to name the official InstructLab Dog's name. There are time are
times when we need to reference the name, and "the logo" or "it" is impersonal
and not fully in the spirit of what we are trying to accomplish with our project.
This is a way to help formalize it so we can reference the dog as an individual.

## How to determine the name

This is undecided at the initial writing of this dev-doc, but I propose we add to
the "proposed" names, and use the comments on this PR as a justification for the name
we propose as. As in example I'll comment on the first one with the name I'm suggesting.

## Proposed Names

- Lemme
- Ruffles
- Pedro
- Alan Turing (Alan for short)
