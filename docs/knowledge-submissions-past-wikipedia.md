# Knowledge Submissions Past Wikipedia

## Problem Statement

For us to continue building our knowledge taxonomy tree we need more trusted places to
teach our models about the world. Wikipedia can get us only so far, so we need safe
places we can take the data from.

## Proposed Solution

Due to the restrictions of copyright law, and how the internet is put together
we need a list of possible places we can eventually approve as content providers.
This document is will provide places that we would like to propose other then
Wikipedia for our legal experts to start investigating if they can be
on the [approved list][approved]. We have questions and thoughts from
community members on places that should be approved, so here is a place
can continue the discussion and track ideas from our community.

### Proposed Domains

Status:

- `approved`: Approved by the legal team, and posted on the [approved list][approved].
- `denied`: Denied by the legal team, and posted on the [avoided list][avoided].
- `submitted`: Sent to the legal team for review
- `proposed`: The community would like to propose this as a possible place to take knowledge submissions from.

| Domain name | Status |
| ----------  | -----  |
| <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page> | approved |
| <https://www.congress.gov/> | proposed |
| <https://www.whitehouse.gov/> | proposed |
| <https://www.senate.gov/> | proposed |
| <https://www.irs.gov/> | proposed |

### Next steps

1. We have to find the correct legal person to find a way to be the correct point person for this project.
1. Collect suggested places from the community and add them to the above table
1. Work with our legal team to get approvals and denials.
1. Inform the triage team and triagers of the new locations we can or can not accept.
