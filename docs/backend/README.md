# InstructLab Backend Working Group

## Introduction

The InstructLab project to date has produced a
[CLI](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab) that allows the execution of
the InstructLab workflow on a variety of single-machine footprints.

Some members of the InstructLab project also operate some backend services that
produce regular full model builds using contributions to the
[taxonomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/). This runs in a larger
clustered environment. This original backend is not built in a way that is
easily reusable by others. It is a goal of the InstructLab project to produce an
evolution of these backend capabilities that is more easily reusable by others.

The InstructLab Backend Working Group represents a group of contributors
interested in evolving the InstructLab backend capabilities. The group is open
to all contributors interested in this work.

## Group Membership

There is no formal membership of this group. Those interested in contributing
just need to show up and participate in the work of the group.

## Primary Artifacts Produced by the Group

The primary artifacts produced by the InstructLab Backend Working Group are
architecture and design docs in the `docs/backend` directory of this repository.
This is where the group will work out high-level planning for various components
that should be created.

Once individual components are created and implementation is in progress, code
and associated documents for that component will be stored in those
repositories.

## Communication

Communication among the group occurs in the following ways:

- **Meetings**: The group meets regularly on a schedule determined by the group.
  Meetings are open to all interested contributors. Meeting times are posted in
  the [InstructLab Community
  Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_23c2f092cd6d147c45a9d2b79f815232d6c3e550b56c3b49da24c4b5d2090e8f%40group.calendar.google.com).

- **Discord**: The group has various channels for corresponding components such as `#core`, `#sdg`, `#sdg`, `#eval`, and `#infra`, which can all be found in the [InstructLab Discord](https://instructlab.ai/discord).

- **Slack**: The group uses the `#backend` channel in the InstructLab Slack.

- **Mailing Lists**: There is a [development mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/a/instructlab.ai/g/dev) should the group desire
to share or discuss topics by email.

- **GitHub**: Artifacts produced by this group will be stored in the
  `docs/backend` directory of this repository and will be reviewed via GitHub
  pull requests. GitHub Issues may also be used to track work items as needed.
