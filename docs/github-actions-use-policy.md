# GitHub Actions Use Policy for InstructLab

This document describes the use policy for GitHub Actions (actions) in workflows for all repositories in the [InstructLab](https://github.com/instructlab) organization.

## Background

GitHub Actions are an important tool for CI/CD use within the repositories of the InstructLab project.
One of the main values is to verify the quality of pull requests for things like tests passing, spelling checks, well-formedness of files, etc.
Repositories may also use actions to build and publish releases for the project.

Since actions play a critical role in the project, care must be taken in how they are used due to their place in the security of the software supply chain of the project.

## Dependabot

Each repository using GitHub Actions must configure Dependabot to manage the action dependencies.
The repository must contain a `.github/dependabot.yml` file with the following minimum configuration:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  # Maintain dependencies for GitHub Actions
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
```

Repository maintainers must review and respond to all pull requests submitted by Dependabot in a timely manner.

## SHAs instead of tags

GitHub Actions must be referenced using SHA values for a specific commit.
Use of other reference types such as tag or branch names is not permitted.

```yaml
- name: Git Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@0ad4b8fadaa221de15dcec353f45205ec38ea70b # v4.1.4
```

instead of

```yaml
- name: Git Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

The use of SHAs can avoid security issues if the tag or branch of the action is moved to a malicious commit.
We also gain build repeatability for future builds by referring to a precise revision of the action.

Since we use Dependabot to manage our action dependencies, Dependabot will handle the chore of using the proper SHA values in the submitted pull requests when action dependencies are updated.

## Trusted Providers of GitHub Actions

There are many GitHub Actions available in GitHub.
Not all can be necessarily trusted.
The InstructLab project must maintain a list of allowed providers and a list of denied providers.

Allowed providers will include all GitHub created actions (`actions/*`) as well as other official actions such as Python Packaging actions (`pypa/*`).
We will need to inventory the current use of actions within the project's repositories to build out the list of allowed and denied providers.

The InstructLab organization's Settings->Actions->General must be configured to allow select actions including actions created by GitHub along with the allowed providers.
Adding additional actions to the allowed providers list will require approval by the organization maintainers along with updating the organization's settings.

## Harden the GitHub Action runner

To further increase security, the first step of each job in a workflow must be the [`step-security/harden-runner`](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner) action.
This action hardens the action runner by implementing network egress control and some infrastructure security.

```yaml
- name: "Harden Runner"
  uses: step-security/harden-runner@a4aa98b93cab29d9b1101a6143fb8bce00e2eac4 # v2.7.1
  with:
    egress-policy: audit # TODO: change to 'egress-policy: block' after couple of runs
```

Each execution of the workflow job will produce a report showing endpoints accessed by the job and possible source file overwrites.
The report will also suggest modifications to the harden-runner action's configuration to further increase security.

```yaml
- name: "Harden Runner"
  uses: step-security/harden-runner@a4aa98b93cab29d9b1101a6143fb8bce00e2eac4 # v2.7.1
  with:
    disable-sudo: true
    egress-policy: block
    allowed-endpoints: >
      github.com:443
```

Hardening the action runner like this can prevent malicious or misbehaving actions or the misuse of actions from exfiltrating secrets.
The article [Harden-Runner Defends Against Arbitrary Command Execution in tj-actions/changed-files GitHub Action](https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/defend-against-arbitrary-command-execution-in-tj-actions-changed-files) shows how the misuse of an action could allow an attacker with a well-crafted pull request to exfiltrate secrets.
